# crypto_cauchy

Exploring how best to model daily returns of crypto using basic scipy
tools.

For instance, cauchy fit distribution seems to do a better job than a
normal distribution of modelling interday open returns for ETH-USD. 

This is consistent with work done by others. E.g. https://theeconreview.com/2018/03/22/ethereum-daytrading-like-tossing-a-coin/

Sample data was obtained from Yahoo Finance: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD/history
